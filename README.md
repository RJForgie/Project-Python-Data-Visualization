# Data Scraping and Visualisation

Project completed as part of CodeClan 16 week intensive Software Development bootcamp.

I built a Python scraper to obtain data and a simple Django site to display it.

Built to learn Python and the Django framework.

## Brief

For the final CodeClan project we had the freedom to explore new languages and frameworks not covered in the course. I chose the following objectives for the week:

* Learns fundamentals of Python language
* Learn about data science
* Use a framework to build a simple display site
* Present the data visually
